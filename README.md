# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
## Background and Objectives
This dataset consists of part of passenger’s information in Titanic which sank during her maiden voyage in 1912 because of colliding with an iceberg. The whole dataset consists of 1309 records and 12 variables which means there are 1309 passengers with some information about their identities could be found in the dataset such as age, gender and class of cabin…However, it is not a complete dataset due to many null values. There is still missing information about their ages or whether they were survived at last. Those null values will be the target in this task.
  
Thus, there are mainly three objectives. Firstly, ANN model will be applied to predict the missing age in the dataset during the data preparation stage. However, the final target of this task will be prediction on passenger’s survival. Therefore, the dataset with filled nulls in first objective will be a training dataset for predict passenger’s survival later. Four DM techniques including Classification tree, Artificial neural network, Logistic regression and K-nearest neighbor will be compared to obtain the best prediction performance. Finally, the model with best performance will be refined to improve the performance.
